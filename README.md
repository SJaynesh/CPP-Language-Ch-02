# 2. Programming with OOPs

> * `POP` => Procedure Oriented Programming : C , Pascal , FORTRAN 
> * `OOP` => Object Oriented Programming : C++,Dart,Java,C#,Python,etc

## `What is OOP?`

<br>

> * **OOP** Stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.

> * OOP is Concept by which code becomes well structured, well Organized, well Secured and increases it's reusability.

> * Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which can contain data and code.

> * It is a concept where every procedure must be done through object.

> * All the logical part of code will be done by object.

> * The data is in the form of field, and the code is in the form of procedures.

<br/><br/>

## `What is OOP?`

<br>

### Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming :

> * OOP is faster and easier to execute.
> * OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
> * OOP helps to keep the C++ code **DRY "DON't REPEAT YOURSELF"**, and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
> * OOP makes it possible to create full reusable application with less code and shorter development time.

<br><br>

## `Principles of OOP :`

> * 4 Principles OOP :
>
>   * 1. Data Encapsulation
>   * 2. Inheritence
>   * 3. Polymorphism
>   * 4. Data Abstraction

<br>

  #### 1. Data Encapsulation (to wrap/combine) :    
	
 <br/>

  > * `Setter` 
  > * `Getter`
  > * `Constructor`
  > * `Destructor`

<br/><br/>

   #### 2. Inheritance (to share) :

<br/>
   
  > * Types :<br>
  > * `Single` 
  > * `Multilevel`
  > * `Hierarchichal`
  > * `Multiple`
  > * `Hybrid` 

<br/><br/>

 #### 3. Polymorphism (to behave in multiple way) :

<br/>
 
  > * 2 types :<br>
  > * `Compile Time : `<br>
  > * Method Overloading
  > * Operator Overloading 
  > * `Run Time`<br>
  > * Method Overriding(over writting)
  > * Virtual Function   

<br/><br/>

 #### 4. Data Abstraction (to secure) :

<br/>
 
  > * `Access Modifiers : `<br>
  > * public
  > * private
  > * protected 
  > * `Abstract class`<br>
  > * pure virtual function

## `Two components of OOP :`

<br>

 > `Class` <br/>
 > `Object` <br/>

<br/><br/>

## `Class & Object :`

<br>

  ### class : 

<br>
  
  > * One type of blueprint structure + UDF
  > * `Collection of Data Members(Attributes) and Data Member Functions(Methods).`
  > * A Class can be considered as a **custom datatype.**

<br>

> * Data Members == Variable == Attributes
> * Member Function == UDF == Methodes

<br><br>

 ### object : 

<br>
 
  > * An object is an instance of a class.
  > * Reference of class.
  > * To access the attributes or methods of class we must create object of class.

<br/><br/>

### Access Modifiers (public & private) :

<br>

> * Access Modifiers in C++ are keywords that define the visibility and accessibility of class members(attribues and methods) within the class and from outside the class.

<br><br>

#### `public`

<br>

 > * Members needed anywhere in whole program for interaction are declared as public.
 > * Can be accessed everywhere throgh object.

<br>

#### `private`

<br>

 > * Members that are internal to the class and should not be accessible from outside are declared as private. 
 > * Limited to class.

<br>

#### `protected` :

<br>

> * Used in class hierachies to allow derived classes to access certain members while keeping them hidden from outside.  
> * Can be accessed in Derived class.
