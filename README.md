# 2. Programming with OOPs

> * `POP` => Procedure Oriented Programming : C
> * `OOP` => Object Oriented Programming : C++,Dart,Java,C#,Python,etc

### - What is Object Oriented Programming ?

> OOP is Concept by which code becomes well structured, well Organized, well Secured and increases it's reusability.

### - Principles of OOP :

> * 4 Principles OOP :
>
>   * 1. Encapsulation
>   * 2. Inheritence
>   * 3. Polymorphism
>   * 4. Data Abstraction


  #### 1. Encapsulation :
  > * Encapsulation means wrapping code as much as you can in a class.
  > * It helps in hiding the implementation details and provides data protection.

  > * `Setter` 
  > * `Getter`
  > * `Constructor`
  > * `Destructor`


   #### 2. Inheritance :
  > * To Share Data class to another class.<br>
  > * Types :<br>
  > * `Single` 
  > * `Multilevel`
  > * `Hierarchichal`
  > * `Multiple`
  > * `Hybrid` 


 #### 3. Polymorphism :
  > * To behave in multiple way
  > * 2 types :<br>
  > * `Compile Time : `<br>
  > * Method Overloading
  > * Operator Overloading 
  > * `Run Time`<br>
  > * Method Overriding(over writting)
  > * Virtual Function   


 #### 4. Data Abstraction :
  > * To Secure.
  > * `Access Modifiers : `<br>
  > * public
  > * private
  > * protected 
  > * `Abstract class`<br>
  > * pure virtual function 


### Class & Object :

  #### class : 
  > * One type of blueprint structure + UDF
  > * `Combination of Data Members and Member Functions.` 
<br><br>
> * Data Members == Variable == Attributes
> * Member Function == UDF == Methodes

 #### object : 
  > * Reference.
  > * `Instance of class.`
